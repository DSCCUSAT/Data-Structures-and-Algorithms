## Steps to follow

### 1. Forking

You can get your own fork/copy of [DS-Algo Notes](https://github.com/DSCCUSAT/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms) by using the <a href="https://github.com/DSCCUSAT/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git"><kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd></a> button.

### 2. Cloning

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
```

> This makes a local copy of repository in your machine.
Once you have cloned the `Data-Structures-and-Algorithms` repository in Github, move to that folder first using change directory command on linux and Mac.

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
$ cd Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

### 3. Syncing it

Always keep your local copy of repository updated with the original repository.
Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the following commands *carefully* to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune
# Switch to `master` branch
$ git checkout master
# Reset local `master` branch to match `upstream` repository's `master` branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/master
# Push changes to your forked `Data-Structures-and-Algorithms` repo
$ git push origin master
```

### 4. Let's Contribute

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing by checking our `Help Wanted` Issues and creating [pull requests](https://github.com/DSCCUSAT/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/pulls).

### 5. Creating a new branch

Whenever you are going to make contribution. Please create separate branch using command and keep your `master` branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```sh
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to branch Branch_Name
$ git checkout -b Branch_Name
```

To switch to desired branch

```sh
# To switch from one branch to other
$ git checkout Branch_Name
```

To add the changes to the branch. Use

```sh
# To add all files to branch Branch_Name
$ git add .
```

Type in a message relevant for the code reveiwer using

```sh
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m 'relevant message'
```

Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using

```sh
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin Branch_Name
```

Finally, go to your repository in browser and click on `compare and pull requests`.
Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your precious effort.

## Help Contributing Guides

We love to have `articles` and `codes` in different languages and `betterment` of existing ones.

Please discuss it with us first by creating new issue.
